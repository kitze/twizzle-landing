      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        We take your privacy very seriously. This policy describes all information collected or submitted on
        the Twizzy application for macOS, and what we do with it.

      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>
        Twizzy allows you to access the direct-message functionality provided by Twitter. We act as a web
        browser and do not collect any personally-identifying information.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you use Twitter functionalities, like direct messages, to which Twizzy gives you access, you
        trust Twitter with your information and accept their terms of use, which can be found here:
        https://twitter.com/en/tos.

      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>No Personally-Identifying Information is transmitted to our servers when using Twizzy.</p>

      <p>
        We collect anonymous usage data and crash reports through Sentry. This makes it easier for us to
        troubleshoot problems and improve Twizzy. Hence Usage Data is collected only to operate and improve
        the app and customer support.

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        The security of your personal data also depends on you. You should not share your Twitter username and
        password with anyone. If you believe or find out that your login credentials are in the wrong hands,
        you should immediately change your password. We also recommend activating Twitter 2-Step Verification.
        We are not responsible for such unauthorized access.
